# BikeShare
Authors: Hannah Babe and Alessandra Vennema

Abstract: Biking is an integral part of transportation systems in cities; they reduce congestion and CO2 emissions, increase accessibility, and provide both physical and mental health benefits. Bike Share programs in particular are hailed for their convenience and practicality. According to the Institute for Transportation and Development Policy, over 600 cities have implemented bike-share systems. In this project we will build and train a neural network to predict the number of bikeshare users on a given day. This will allow us to analyze bikeshare usage and begin to understand what impacts user behavior. We are particularly intrested in how weather, day of the week and time of day impact the number of riders. The data set used is subset of rides from the NYC CitiBike Open Trip Data and can be found here https://ride.citibikenyc.com/system-data
The set consist of 34,000 rides occurring between Jan 2015 and June 2017.
